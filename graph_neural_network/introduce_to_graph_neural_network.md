# Introduce to Graph Neural Network

## Basic Concept
**Feature of Graph** 
- Locally connected structure
- Shared weights reduce the computational costcompared with traditional spectral graph theory
- Multi-layerstructure is the key to deal with hierarchical patterns, which captures the features of various sizes.

**Graph Embedding**  
Learn to represent graph nodes, edges, or subgraphs in low-dimensional vectors
